## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories

    - First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time User, I want to fully understand what this game is. I can see as soon as I run the game that the game is called Pirate Ship and shows me a brief description of the game. The game seems to closely resemble Battleships.

        2. As a First Time User, I want to understand how to play the game. After typing in my name to the game, the game responds with my name which is nice to personalize the game, and gives me a very thorough explanation on how to play the game. I know exactly what is expected of me, what I need to achieve in this game, and how I can achieve it. 

        3. As a First Time User, I want feedback on whether I have hit the computer ships or if the computer ship has hit mine. The game is very thorough in communicating with me whether my ship or the computer's ship has been hit and always shows me an updated view of the board after every turn.

        4. As a First Time User, I want to know my final score at the end of the game and to be communicated with if I have lost or won the game. At the end of the game, the game tells me if I have lost or won and gives me an appropriate message for each occassion, and then shows me my final score. 

    - Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning / Frequent Visitor, I want to be able to play the game again and have the board reshuffled. When I finish playing the game or each time I run the program, the board is reshuffled which makes the game start again from scratch.
